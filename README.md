# Simple-TextAnimation
This repository features a simple HTML and JavaScript example that demonstrates a text click animation. Each letter in the list becomes active with a distinct style when clicked. The JavaScript code utilizes event listeners to add and remove the "active" class, triggering a custom styling effect. The accompanying HTML structure and CSS styling create an engaging user experience. Clone the repository and explore the code to understand how to implement click-based animations in your web projects.
